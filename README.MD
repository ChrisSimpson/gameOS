# gameOS v0.1
gameOS theme for Pegasus Frontend

This is currently the beta version of the theme. Filters and game details still to come along with a few other features.

Does not currently support touch controls (coming soon).

An exe has been provided to allow easy sorting of Skraper.net meta files. Simply place it in your rom folder, perform a scrape using Skraper (choosing EmulationStation gamelist.xml as the type) and then run the exe. It will automatically sort the media files into the format that Pegasus can read.
